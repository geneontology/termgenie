Prader 1: Female external genitalia with clitoromegaly. Prader 2: Clitoromegaly with partial labial fusion forming a funnel-shaped urogenital sinus. Prader 3: Increased phallic enlargement. Complete labioscrotal fusion forming a urogenital sinus with a single opening. Prader 4: Complete scrotal fusion with urogenital opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus. Prader 5: Normal male external genitalia. The diagnosis of ambiguous genitalia is made for Prader 1-4." [HPO:probinson, pmid:15102623]
comment: Genetic gender is determined at fertilization, whereby the presence of a Y chromosome determines male gender. Normally, genetic gender determines gonadal gender which in turn determines phenotypic gender. Testicular development is an active process requiring expression of the primary testis determining gene SRY, which is located on the Y chromosome.

def: "The presence of multiple cysts in both kidneys." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Most commonly, PKD arises as an inherited trait. Tremendous enlargement of both kidneys is characteristic of the autosomal dominant form of PKD, with up to hundreds or thousands of renal cysts. This term does not refer to the disease entity but rather to the finding of numerous cysts in both kidneys.

comment: Presumably, use of the suffix ptosis refers to the situation where the patient is supine, and the displacement is downward. Strictly speaking, the term glossoptosis indicates falling of the tongue and thus can also be forward displacement; however by convention it is only used for backward displacement. Glossoptosis may cause obstruction of the airway.

comment: Cleft palate is a developmental defect that occurs between the 7th and 12th week of pregnancy. Normally, the palatine processes fuse during this time to form the soft and hard palate. A failure of fusion results in a cleft palate. The clinical spectrum ranges from bifid uvula, to (incomplete or complete) cleft of the soft palate, up to (complete or incomplete) cleft of both the soft and hard palate.

comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

comment: The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and\napplied inaccurately.

def: "Height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the midline more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the upper lip in the frontal view (subjective)." [pmid:19125428]
comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981], but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively or use the Likert scale for Caucasians and African Americans [Astley and Clarren, 2000]. The height of the vermilion of the upper lip varies among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. The thinness of the upper lip vermilion is sensitive to facial expression. On profile view, a thin vermilion is less convex than usual. A thin upper lip vermilion may be associated with a smooth philtrum and an absence of the Cupid's bow, but these should be assessed separately.

comment: Cephalic index is the ratio of head width expressed as a percentage of head length. The normal range is 76-80.9%. Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. Cephalic index standards are derived from Caucasians and have limited relevance for other races and ethnicities. Current norms also have limited validity because of changes in infant sleeping position and consequent changes in head shape. New data should be developed. Brachycephaly is distinct from Flat occiput, but both can be present in the same individual and should be coded separately.

comment: Turricephaly is derived from the Latin word turris, meaning tall, and refers to a round, tall (tower-like) skull. This feature may have previously been considered to overlap with or include a tall forehead. Turricephaly is present when the head appears tall (subjective) and head length and width are reduced compared to normal age-related standards (objective). Head length is measured between the glabella (the most prominent point on the frontal bone above the root of the nose) and the most prominent part of the occiput in the midline, using spreading calipers. Head width is measured between the most lateral points of the parietal bones on each side of the head, using spreading calipers. The term acrocephaly (or oxycephaly) is used when there is turricephaly and the top of the skull assumes a cone shape.

comment: Hearing loss can be categorized by which part of the auditory system is damaged, as conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and mixed hearing loss. Another axis of classification uses the degree of hearing impairment. The degree of hearing loss is computed by using a three frequency average taken at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. The average of these three frequencies is called the Pure Tone Average (PTA). 0-20 dB is considered normal, 21-40 dB mild loss, 41-60 dB moderate loss, 61-70 dB moderately severe loss,71-90 dB severe loss, and greater than 90 dB profound loss. Note that the word deafness is occasionally used to describe partial hearing loss. In the HPO, following the definition of the World Health Organization, we use the word deafness to refer to complete loss of the ability to hear, and hearing impairment to refer to any degree of reduced hearing.

Spasmodic torticollis is a focal dystonia that affects the neck and sometimes the shoulders, leading to involuntary contractions of the neck muscles, abnormal movements and postures of the head and neck. The abnormal movements can have both tonic and clonic components and can results in pain and discomfort. Spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia.

As the milder forms of this finding are clearly subjective and no boundary of subjective and objective is defined, the term is considered subjective. The term eyelid coloboma has been replaced because the word coloboma should be used only for defects at the site of fusion of embryologic structures, which is not the case here. Modifiers to designate the location of the cleft may be added, such as lower and lateral.

comment: The diagnosis of oligodontia requires a radiograph, as is true for anodontia and for the other designation of tooth agenesis, hypodontia. The terms hypodontia and oligodontia are sometimes used interchangeably in the literature while on other occasions hypodontia is used for selective agenesis of six or less missing teeth while oligodontia is applied when there are more than six missing teeth. Tooth agenesis or oligodontia/hypodontia can be mistaken for delayed eruption and again a radiograph is needed for diagnosis. Absence of teeth may be congenital (tooth agenesis) or acquired. The incidence of congenital absence of teeth is different depending on the type and position of the tooth [Gorlin et al, 2001].

It should be carefully noted that slight spacing between the primary teeth is normal, so experience in evaluation is important in determining this feature.

comment: Standard reference has means and standard deviations by gender [Moyers et al, 1976]. It is easy to measure the width of teeth, for which reason the definition of microdontia can be made with reference to the width of the tooth. However, microdontia means that the overall size of the tooth is decreased. In microdontia, the gaps between the teeth, particularly the anterior upper and lower teeth, are increased, creating diastemata. This should be assessed and coded separately.

comment: A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fatty tissue. They are the most common form of soft tissue tumor and are usually soft to the touch, movable, and generally painless (but there is a separate entity of painful multiple lipomas which is a hereditary disease called Dercum disease or adiposis dolorosa). Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeters. Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in children.

def: "The term large for gestational age applies to babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age." [eMedicine:262679, HPO:probinson]
comment: Fetal macrosomia has been defined in several different ways, including birth weight of 4000-4500 g (8 lb 13 oz to 9 lb 15 oz) or greater than 90% for gestational age after correcting for neonatal sex and ethnicity. Based on these definitions, macrosomia affects 1-10% of all pregnancies. A diagnosis of fetal macrosomia can be made only by measuring birth weight after delivery; therefore, the condition is confirmed only retrospectively, ie, after delivery of the neonate.

Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis.

def: "Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a type of ventriculoarterial connection in which both great vessels arise entirely or predominantly from the right ventricle." [HPO:probinson, pmid:10798433]
comment: During the development of the heart, the outflow tract initially connects exclusively with the primitive right ventricle and must undergo extensive remodelling to divide into a separate pulmonary artery and aorta; subsequently, there is continued remodelling to establish direct continuity from the left ventricle to the aorta. DORV encompasses a wide spectrum of anatomic arrangements and pathophysiologic disturbances. At one end of the spectrum, it mimics tetralogy of Fallot in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, or a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the absence of such stenosis. At the other end of the spectrum, it behaves like transposition of the great arteries with a VSD.

comment: Anemia is not a specific entity but can result from many underlying pathologic processes. The three main causes of anemia are blood loss, decreased or faulty red blood cell production, and increased destruction of red blood cells. Various classifications are in clinical use including a classification according to the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the erythrocytes: microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Anemias can also be classified according to variations in cell size and shape, as reflected by the red-cell distribution width (RDW). Additionally, anemias can be classified into those of inadequate production and hemolytic anemias.

comment: Homocystine is a disulfide derivate of homocysteine (a precursor of cysteine). Patients with homocystinuria have a clinical phenotype similar to that of patients affected by Marfan syndrome (pectus excavatum, dislocated lenses, etc). This term does not describe the disease entity, but rather the finding of an increased concentration of homocystine in urine, which can be easily detected by a sensitive test for disulphide compounds (the cyanide-nitroprusside reaction) and using chromatographic techniques. Homocystinuria can be caused by biochemical defects including cystathionine B-synthase deficiency, N5-methyltetrahydrofolate:homocystine methyltransferase deficiency, N5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, and methhylcobalamin deficiency.

The neurons in heterotopia appear to be normal, except for their mislocation; nuclear studies have shown glucose metabolism equal to that of normally positioned gray matter. The condition causes a variety of symptoms, but usually includes some degree of epilepsy or recurring seizures, and often affects the brain's ability to function on higher levels. Symptoms range from nonexistent to profound, in which case heterotopia can result in severe seizure disorder, loss of motor skills, and mental retardation." [HPO:curators]

comment: Headache is one of the most common types of recurrent pain as well as one of the most frequent symptoms in neurology. In addition to occasional headaches, there are well-defined headache disorders that vary in incidence, prevalence and duration and can be divided into two broad categories. In secondary headache disorders, headaches are attributed to another condition, such as brain tumour or head injury; for the primary disorders the headache is not due to another condition.

The absence of crossing fibers also leads to a reduction in the anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain and deepening of the interpeduncular cistern.

comment: Hypothalamic hamartoma is a malformation, not a tumor. Hypothalamic hamartomas grow at the rate of, or slower than, the surrounding brain tissue. A hamartoma of the hypothalamus appears as a non-enhancing mass in the floor of the third ventricle posterior to the optic chiasm that is isointense to grey matter on T1 and T2 pulse sequences of an MRI, but may have distinct intensity on FLAIR (neither cranial CT examination nor cranial ultrasound examination is adequate for diagnosis of hypothalamic hamartom). Individuals with hypothalamic hamartomas may have neurologic symptoms, although most are asymptomatic. Removal of the hypothalamic hamartoma is not indicated and often results in iatrogenic pituitary insufficiency.

[HPO:probinson, pmid:11110959]
comment: This sign is observed upon magnetic resonance tomography (MRI). It can be seen in several diseases including Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, where the pathophysiology has been hypothesized to be related to iron deposition in the globus pallidus (associated with low signal intensity on T2-weighted images) accompanied by other pathological processes such as gliosis and water accumulation that are responsible for the high signal intensity at the central globus pallidus.

However, the word can also be used to describe the presence of a congenital defects of bones or connective tissues that are found in one or more of the diseases, especially on prenatal ultrasound, i.e., a situation in which it is often not yet possible to make an exact etiological diagnosis. This is the sense of the phrase we use in the HPO.

comment: A basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer which rarely metastasizes, but is still considered malignant because it can cause significant destruction and disfigurement by invading surrounding tissues. In 80 percent of all cases, basal cell cancers are found on the head and neck or on other sun-exposed areas of the body. Apart from sporadic basal cell carcinoma, there are hereditary conditions such as the basal cell nevus syndrome where patients develop multiple basal cell carcinomas throughout life.

comment: Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) is related to fetal akinesia owing to fetal neurogenic, muscle, or connective tissue disorders or occasionally to maternal conditions. AMC can be associated with polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, micrognathia, ocular hypertelorism, and short umbilical cord. AMC is a feature of a heterogeneous group of disorders, some of which have the phrase 'arthrogryposis multiplex congenita' as a part of their name (for instance, Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 or AMCD1). This term refers to the finding of multiple joint contractures found throughout the body at birth rather than to the disease entities of which this is a clinical feature.

def: "An impairment of the class-switch recombination process that normally leads B lymphocytes to produce IgG, IgA, or IgE." [HPO:probinson, pmid:11544001]
comment: The generation of the antibody repertoire requires two successive steps. The first is antigen- and T-cell-independent; it takes place in the fetal liver and the bone marrow. Immature B lymphocytes rearrange their immunoglobulin-gene variable segments (V segments), diversity segments (D segments) and joining segments (J segments), producing a functionally integrated VDJ segment linked to the mu constant region (C-mu), which determines the primary antibody repertoire composed of IgM antibodies. The second step is antigen- and T-cell-dependent and takes place in secondary lymphoid organs. After encountering antigen, B cells proliferate and form germinal centers. In this unique anatomic formation, two genetic events lead to generation of the secondary antibody repertoire: class-switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM). CSR of immunoglobulins occurs by a recombination process between two different switch regions (S regions) located upstream of each C region. Replacement of C-mu by a constant region of another class of immunoglobulin (C-gamma, C-alpha or C-epsilon) ensues and leads to the production of IgG, IgA or IgE.

comment: Accumulation of intracellular autofluorescent material or aging pigment has been characterized as a normal aging event. Lipofuscin (from the Greek word for fat and the Latin word for dark), refers to intracellular autofluorescent material that accumulates in aging cells with a excitation wavelength between 320 and 480 nm and an emission wavelength between 460 and 630 nm. Lpofuscin consists of a mixture of oxidized proteins and lipids, carbohydrates and trace amount of metals. Ceroid iss a lipofuscin-like lipopigment that arises from pathological conditions such as disease, malnutrition, and cell stress. Subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase makes up approximately 40% of this lipopigment/ceroid accumulation.

comment: Fragile sites can be defined as heritable specific loci on human chromosomes that exhibit non-random gaps, constrictions or breaks when chromosomes are exposed to specific cell culture conditions. Over 120 different fragile sites have been identified in the human genome. Some of these sites are sensitive to folate, that is, they can be induced by a culture medium deficient in folic acid and thymidine, and hence a medium with lowered levels of dTTP or dCTP, two immediate components of DNA, or by a medium enriched either in methotrexate, an inhibitor of folate metabolism, or in fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthesis. The folate-dependent fragile phenotype occurs if more than a critical number of CCG/CGG repeats are present (e.g., > 230 repeats for FRAXA).

[HPO:probinson]
comment: Regitine produces an alpha-adrenergic block of relatively short duration. In the regitine blocking test, regitine is injected rapidly and bood pressure is recorded immediately after injection, at 30-second intervals for the first 3 minutes, and at 60-second intervals for the next 7 minutes. A positive response to the reginitine blocking test is present when the blood pressure is reduced more than 35 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A typical positive response is a reduction in pressure of 60 mmHg systolic and 25 mmHg diastolic. A positive response is suggestive of pheochromocytoma and should generally be confirmed by other diagnostic procedures such as measurement of urinary catecholamines or their metabolites.

Histochemical stains such as toluidine blue and Alcian blue can be used to detect such intracellular glycosaminoglycans which, being negatively charged, are bound and precipitated by the cationic dyes. Cultured fibroblasts from homozygotes -and heterozygotes for the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses accumulate excessive quantities of glycosaminoglycans. The cytoplasmic staining with toluidine blue is referred to as metachromasia (pink) and orthochromasia (blue) and that with Alcian blue as alcianophilia.

def: "A premature fusion of the epiphyseal plates of the radius. Epiphyseal plates are located at the distal and proximal ends of the long bones, in this case of the radius and premature fusion will have an effect on the growh of the radial bone, inhibiting or at least disturbing the normal growth and development of the bone." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: The epiphyseal plate (or epiphysial plate, physis, or growth plate) is a hyaline cartilage plate in the metaphysis at each end of a long bone. The plate is found in children and adolescents; in adults, who have stopped growing, the plate is replaced by an epiphyseal line. The growth plate has a very specific morphology in having a zonal arrangement. The growth plate includes a relatively inactive reserve zone at the epiphyseal end, moving distally into a proliferative and then hyper trophic zone and ending with a band of ossifying cartilage (the metaphysis).

def: "This term applies to all changes in bone mineralisation and or ossification which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atypic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralisation of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ." [HPO:curators]

def: "The presence of a notch in the margin of the `ala nasi` (FMA:59519)." [pmid:19152422]
comment: The alae nasi are the lateral portions of the nose or the wings of the nostrils, which partly encircle the nostrils (nares). They are usually about the width of the columella, but vary greatly depending on the shape of the nostril. Note that individuals may be described as having a cleft ala nasi, but have a severely Underdeveloped ala nasi. In an underdeveloped ala the continuity of the tissue encircling the nostril is undisturbed while in a cleft it is disrupted. The term coloboma has been replaced because a coloboma is a remnant of a physiologically occurring discontinuity of tissue; the alae nasi do not have such a discontinuity.

This is thus probably mainly used as a bundled term and should be replaced by better descriptions in the future.

comment: Reduced convexity of the occiput gives an appearance of flattening. There are no objective measures for convexity of the occiput, and evaluation depends heavily on the experience of the observer. This finding may or may not be accompanied by Brachycephaly (which should be coded separately), and may be observed more frequently when an infant is placed to sleep on his/her back. Occipital plagiocephaly can result from fusion or sclerosis of the lambdoid suture. If unilateral, this is accompanied by unilateral occipital flattening and bulging of the ispilateral frontal bone.

comment: DIC is a complex syndrome in which there is pathological generation of thrombin and diffuse intravascular clot formation. DIC may occur as acute decompensated or chronic compensated form. In acute decompensated DIC, there is a sudden massive exposure of tissue factor over a brief time period; Intravascular coagulation can also compromise the blood supply to organs and, in conjunction with hemodynamic and metabolic derangements, may contribute to the failure of multiple organs. At the same time, the use and subsequent depletion of platelets and coagulation proteins resulting from the ongoing coagulation may induce severe bleeding. Chronic DIC, also known as compensated DIC, results from a persistent weak or intermittent activating stimulus. Under such conditions, destruction and production of coagulation factors and platelets are balanced.

comment: Renal cell carcinoma (also known as hypernephroma) is the most common form of kidney cancer arising from the proximal renal tubule. The tissue of origin for renal cell carcinoma is the proximal renal tubular epithelium. Renal cell carcinoma can be classified as 1) clear cell carcinoma, 2) papillary carcinoma, 3) chromophobe renal carcinoma, and 4) collecting duct carcinoma.

def: "Avascular necrosis of the `proximal epiphysis of the femur` (FMA:32841) occurring in growing children and caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the head of the femur close to the hip joint. The necrosis is characteristically associated with flattening of the femoral head, for which reason the term coxa plana has been used to refer to this feature in the medical literature." [HPO:probinson]
comment: In medical parlance, this is often referred to as Legg Calve Perthes disease. Here, the name 'Avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis' is preferred to emphasize that the term refers to a phenotypic feature rather than a disease entity. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may result in pain in the hip, limp, stiffness and reduced range of motion, and some degree of atrophy of the affected leg. The phrase Legg Perthes syndrome or Legg Calve Perthes disease is also used to refer to a number of diseases, including the idiopathic form and a form that is related to mutation in the COL2A1 gene (MIM 150600). Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 to 10 years old, and is clinically characterized by limping, hip stiffness, limited range of motion, and can result in restriction of growth of the affected leg and wasting of the muscles of the upper thigh.

Congenital muscular torticollis is thus etiologically and phenotypically distinct from spasmodic torticollis.

comment: In anterior segment mesenchymal ocular dysgenesis (ASMOD), multiple tissues are affected, including the iris, cornea, and lens as well as the Schlemm's canal and trabecular meshwork drainage structures located at the anterior segment angle where the iris and cornea meet. These abnormalities may result from a primary defect in the migration and/or differentiation of the mesenchymal cells that contribute to development of the cornea, iris, and drainage structures.

comment: Presenile cataract is rare. Some cases have a hereditary cause; others result from trauma or chromosomal, endocrine, metabolic, or systemic disorders. Many cases are idiopathic. The term 'presenile' is used differently in the literature. The HPO defines it to mean a cataract that is diagnosed after the age of 20 years but before old age.

comment: The simultaneous occurrence a low thyroid hormone level and a normal or low serum level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with hypothyroidism establishes the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. The administration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which is normally synthesized and released by the hypothalamus, enables the physician to distinguish between pituitary and hypothalamic causes of hypothyroidism.\nTRH will normally cause the release of TSH from the pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus does not synthesize or release TRH, the administration of exogenous TRH will result in prompt rise of serum TSH. To date, the cases reported of pituitary hypothyroidism. Hypothalamic hypothyroidism, on the other hand, may either be idiopathic or result from demonstrable hypothalamic disease.

comment: Renal aminoaciduria is characterized by the abnormally elevated levels of amino acids in the urine, and is usually related to genetic mutations of transport proteins result in the defective reabsorption of free amino acids at the proximal renal tubules. This term does not refer directly to the group of corresponding disease entities but rather to the finding of elevated levels of amino acids in the urine which is inferred to be related to a renal defect rather than to a primary defect of aminoacid metabolism on the basis of other findings.

Usually, pulsatile tinnitus is heard as a lower pitched thumping or booming, a rougher blowing sound which is coincidental with respiration, or as a clicking, higher pitched rhythmic sensation. Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus."

def: "The presence of a `teratoma` (MPATH:322)." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Teratomas are germ-cell tumors commonly composed of multiple cell types derived from one or more of the three germ layers. They derive from embryonic pluripotent cells and may have various degrees of maturation, according to which they are classified as mature, immature, and malignant. Teratomas are found with decreasing frequency in the ovaries and testis, mediastinum, retroperitoneal space, sacrococcygeal zone, pineal and other intracranial locations.

comment: This feature gives the appearance of a tall forehead, and may or may not include reduction of hair in the temporal areas. This can be distinguished from male pattern baldness as the hairline is the superior boundary of the muscular forehead, which can be actively wrinkled, in contrast to the scalp where no wrinkling can occur. In addition, texture of the skin of the scalp differs from the texture of the skin over the forehead.

def: "This foot deformity is also known as rocker bottom feet (pes valgus), a rigid flatfoot deformity (as opposed to a flexible calcaneovalgus foot) caused by a malpositioned navicular bone at the neck of the talus; the ankle is in severe equinus and the forefoot in dorsiflexion, rocker bottom-like, accompanied by contraction of the talonavicular, deltoid and calcaneal cuboidal ligaments. The foot examination usually reveals a rigid foot with a \"reversed\" arch, a convex plantar surface, and a deep crease on the lateral dorsal side of the foot. The ankle joint is plantarflexed, while the midfoot and forefoot are extended upward. Lateral foot radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis." [HPO:curators]

def: "Height of the vermilion of the medial part of the lower lip more than 2 SD below the mean. Alternatively, an apparently reduced height of the vermilion of the lower lip in the frontal view (subjective)." [pmid:19125428]
comment: Normal values for the height of the vermilion are available [Farkas, 1981] but measurements are not commonly used. Most clinicians determine this feature subjectively. The height of the vermilion of the lower lip varies considerably among ethnic groups, and the vermilion should be compared to a population of same ethnic background. If the lower lip vermilion is thin, the inferior border of the vermilion is less curved, and on a profile view, the lower lip vermilion is less convex than usual.

There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

comment: A developmental defect resulting in the presence of a thyroglossal cyst, a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. During the embryologic development of the thyroid gland, the precursor of the thyroid migrates from the base of the tongue inferiorly though the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally disappears following the development and migration of the thyroid gland, but if a portion of the duct remain it can form a thyroglossal cyst.

def: "Elevated `7-dehydrocholesterol` (CHEBI:17759) levels." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.

comment: Phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl hexadecanoic acid) is a fatty acid that is derived from chlorophyll and present in the diet. The metabolism of phytanic acid involves alpha-oxidation in the peroxisome, which converts phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Peroxisomes involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid. Peroxisomal malfunctioning can lead to over-accumulation of very long chain fatty acids and phytanic acid, among other things.

Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it. Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy (disease involving only one nerve) and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis.

def: "An abnormal lack of stability of the cervical spine." [HPO:curators]
comment: The cervical spine is made up of two anatomically and functionally distinct segments: the upper cervical spine (C1and C2), which possesses the most rotational mobility with some degrees of frontal and sagittal plane mobility, and the lower cervical spine, which allows for two types of movements - flexion-extension and inclination-rotation. Cervical instability mainly involves the upper cervical spine, particularly between C1 and C2. Craniocervical ligaments are the main determinants of cervical spine stability.

name: Mirror image dupliction of digits
namespace: medical_genetics
def: "A mirror-like duplication of the digits of the hands or feet leading to an appearance were radio/ulnar and/or fibular/tibial aspects of the hands and/or feet can not be destinguished anymore. Depending on severity this might also affect the bones of the forarm or lower leg in such a way that there might be two ulnae rather than one radius and ulna each. The same may be seen for the fibula and tibia." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Transplantation of the ZPA (zone of polarised activity) to the anterior margin of a limb bud in the chick results in mirror image duplication of limb elements (Tabin, 1991). Similarly, mirror image duplication in the forelimb of the mouse has been observed with ectopic expression of Hox b-8 (Charit6 et al, 1994). Mirror hand anomaly in humans has been shown to be due to either aberrant positioning of the ZPA or altered inductive interactions of the Shh gene resulting in impairment of the mechanism responsible for the organization and differentiation of the limb bud, rather than a primary duplication event. In other words, the primary event results in failure of the radial ray to develop. The ulnar area will then induce the differentiation of two groups of ulnar rays. Timing of this insult could play a critical role in severity of this phenotypic feature. Syndromal mirror hand is probably due to agene mutation of the Shh gene (Hersh et al, 1995). Finally, the multiple hand deformity may be explained by true duplication of the ZPA.

comment: During lens terminal differentiation, the originally cuboidal lens vesicle cells elongate into long fiber-like cells, or fibers. Y-shaped sutures form because of how the lens epithelial cells proliferate during formation. The Y sutures demarcate the boundaries between the lens cortex, which is peripheral to the Y sutures, and the lens nucleus, which is within and includes the Y sutures. The anterior Y suture is oriented upright, and the posterior Y suture is inverted.

In the hypertrophic form recurrent edema results in orbital fat herniation through a weakened orbital septum. Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads." [PMID:3207663]
comment: Most patients who have blepharochalasis present in an atrophic condition with atrophy of redundant eyelid skin and superior nasal fat pads. Most of these atrophic patients do not go through a hypertrophic phase. Multiple attacks of eyelid edema result in thinning, stretching, and atrophy of eyelid tissues. The eyelid skin becomes redundant, discolored, and atrophic, appearing like wrinkled cigarette paper. The upper eyelids are more commonly affected, but the lower eyelids may also be involved. Blepharochalasis is not synonymous with dermatochalasis.

comment: In frontal view, with the face relaxed, the apparent height of the upper lip vermilion is excessive and the upper incisors may be visible. On profile view, the vermilion is more convex than usual. An everted upper lip may be associated with a short philtrum, and may be secondary to protruded upper teeth, but these should be assessed and described separately.

namespace: medical_genetics
def: "The burst suppression pattern in electroencephalography refers to a characteristic periodic pattern of low voltage (<10 microvolts) suppressed background and a relatively shorter pattern of higher amplitude slow, sharp, and spiking complexes." [HPO:probinson]
comment: Burst suppression can occur in a generalized or lateralized distribution and is often a sign of severe encephalopathy. Generally, an interburst interval of 30 seconds or less is associated with a better prognosis than longer interburst intervals (>30 sec).

def: "EEG abnormalities (epileptiform discharges) evoked by flashing lights or black and white striped patterns." [HPO:probinson]
comment: In some patients, seizures can be provoked by specific external factors (reflex epilepsy), including flickering lights and patterns. These patients commonly show epileptiform discharges in the EEG when stimulated with flashing lights, black and white striped patterns and television. These evoked EEG abnormalities are called photoparoxysmal responses.

def: "Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs)are periodic, lateralized, and epileptiform. PLEDs show a relatively constant interval between discharges (0.5 to 3 seconds)." [HPO:probinson]
comment: The epileptiform morphology of the discharges is not invariable, as PLEDS are often closer to slow waves than to sharp waves in morphology. PLEDs are often are caused by acute destructive focal lesions. PLEDs are often a transitory phenomenon, disappearing in a matter of weeks, even if the causal lesion persists, and often transforming into a less specific but more persistent focal slow appearance.

Fetal cystic hygroma can be defined as nuchal translucency with or without septations measuring greater than 3.0 mm." [emedicine:402757, HPO:probinson]
comment: Upon ultrasound examination, fetal cystic hygroma presents as a cystic mass with multiple septa with multiple, asymmetric, thin-walled cysts related to the posterior aspect of the neck. Cystic hygromas can range from increased nuchal translucency to thin-walled cystic masses that may become larger than the fetal head. The cysts may result from a lymphatic abnormality, possibly one caused by absent or inefficient connections between the lymphatic and venous systems. Depending on the site, the cut off may vary from site to site. Lowest would be 2.5 mm and highest 3.5 mm.

comment: Increased nuchal translucency may be related to a cystic hygroma or to mesenchymal edema. Increased nuchal translucency can be classified into three categories: 1) cardiac abnormalities, combined with abnormal ductus venosus flow velocities, is found, leading to the theory that cardiac failure causes nuchal translucency enlargement; 2) various types of abnormalities are found in the extracellular matrix of the nuchal skin of fetuses with increased nuchal translucency; 3) abnormal lymphatic development is demonstrated in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.

comment: Zonular cataracts include specific regions of the lens and include nuclear cataracts, which affect the fetal or embryonic lens nucleus and lamellar cataracts. These tend to affect lens fibers that are formed at the same time, resulting in a shell like opacity. Zonular cataracts can also be characterized as dense or pulverulent (dusty appearing), and can be accompanied by arcuate opacities extending into the lens cortex, called cortical riders.

comment: This phenotype is characterized by fiberglasslike or needlelike crystals projecting in different directions, through or close to the axial region of the lens. Some crystals may be 11 mm in length, and their biochemical composition is not known. This type of cataract is considered to be different from the corraliform cataract, which does not show the needlelike projections. This opacity does not appear to respect the sutures or the direction of the lens fibers (Francois 1963) and appears to originate from the fetal and postnatal nuclei, suggesting a congenital origin with some postnatal progression, if any.

comment: Congenital posterior urethral valve is a cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. It results from a failure of resorption of the caudal end of the Wolffian duct into the primitive cloaca at the site of the future verumontanum in the posterior urethra (Following normal resorption of the posterior urethral valve there remain the posterior urethral folds, also called plicae colliculi).

comment: The medical literautre on amyloidosis is confused with clinical and histochemical designations used when the amyloid disease processes were poorly understood. To be designated an amyloid fibril protein, the protein must occur in tissue deposits and exhibit affinity for Congo red and green birefringence when viewed by polarisation microscopy.

comment: Conical incisors are incisors that are round in cross-sectional views of the crown or that have a rounded appearance. Conical incisors may have a pointed shape that tapers to a point at the tip of the tooth. One speaks of conical incisor for a conical shaped tooth that is located in the region where incisors normally are.

comment: The most frequent supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which occurs between the two maxillary central incisors. Often it fails to erupt, but creates a large anterior diastema, and would not be detected on physical examination (requires X-ray evaluation). This designation excludes coexistence of primary and permanent dentition due to delayed loss of the former. Note that this term does not refer to the situation in which two rows of teeth are seen at the time of eruption of permanent dentition before exfoliation of primary teeth, which can be a normal finding.

They may be symmetrical or asymmetrical, with lateral deviation of the eyes or head, or involving only one side of the body. Spasms may be restricted to brief upward deviation of the eyes, and it may be difficult to identify them. Sometimes, the cluster is preceded by an arrest of activity, as if the child was preparing the series. The child often cries after each spasm (Definition from the International League Against Epilepsy website)." [HPO:probinson]

comment: Glial cells are cells that support nerve cells. Schwann cells wrap around the axon to form the myelin sheath. Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology; the conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), schwannomatosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells.

comment: An aberrant or ectopic thyroid gland may occur anywhere along the path of initial descent of the thyroid. A total failure to descend contrasts with the incomplete descent of the thyroid, in which case the resulting final resting point of the gland may be high in the neck or just below the hyoid bone. Appart from an abnormal descent, accessory thyroid tissue can also occur, arising from remnants of the thyroglossal duct anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct tract.

def: "A tic is a sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization involving discrete muscle groups." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Tics can be invisible to the observer, such as abdominal tensing or toe crunching. Common motor and phonic tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing. Movements of other movement disorders (for example, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus) must be distinguished from tics. Other conditions, such as autism and stereotypic movement disorder, also include movements which may be confused with tics. Tics must also be distinguished from the compulsions of OCD and from seizure activity. Tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, boredom, or high-energy emotions, which can include negative emotions, such as anxiety, but positive emotions as well, such as excitement or anticipation. Relaxation may result in a tic increase (for instance, watching television or using a computer), while concentration on an absorbing activity often leads to a decrease in tics.

def: "The presence of a `sarcoma` (MPATH:551)." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A sarcoma (from the Greek sarx meaning flesh) is a general term describing a malignant neoplasm, or cancer, that arises from transformed connective tissue cells such as bone, cartilage and fat cells, which originate from embryonic mesoderm. This is in contrast to carcinomas, which are of epithelial origin (breast, colon, pancreas, and others). However, due to an evolving understanding of tissue origin, the term sarcoma is sometimes applied to tumors now known to arise from epithelial tissue. The term soft tissue sarcoma is used to describe tumors of soft tissue, which includes elements that are in connective tissue, but not derived from it (such as muscles and blood vessels).

def: "Benign, slow-growing tumors without any metastatic potential. Despite their benign nature, they can damage nearby structures causing organ dysfunction. Histologically they resemble low-grade fibrosarcomas, but they are very locally aggressive and tend to recur even after complete resection. There is a tendency for recurrence in the setting of prior surgery and the most common localisation of these tumors is intraabdominal from smooth muscle cells of the instestine." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Most cases are sporadic, but some are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Approximately 10% of individuals with Gardner's syndrome, a type of FAP with extracolonic features, have desmoid tumors.\nRisk factors for desmoid disease amongst FAP patients include female gender, a 3' APC mutation, a positive family history and a history of previous abdominal surgery.

def: "A contraction of the diaphragm that repeats several times per minute. In humans, the abrupt rush of air into the lungs causes the epiglottis to close, creating a hic sound. Also known as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter (SDF), or singultus, from the Latin singult, the act of catching one's breath while sobbing. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: A bout of hiccups, in general, resolves itself without intervention, although many home remedies claim to shorten the duration, and medical treatment is occasionally necessary in cases of chronic hiccups. Hiccups are caused by many central and peripheral nervous system disorders, all from injury or irritation to the phrenic and vagus nerves, as well as toxic or metabolic disorders affecting the aforementioned systems. Hiccups often occur after consuming carbonated beverages, alcohol, dry breads, or spicy foods. Prolonged laughter or eating too fast are also known to cause hiccups. Persistent or intractable hiccups may be caused by any condition which irritates or damages the relevant nerves.

def: "Hemiballismus is a rare movement disorder that is caused primarily by damage to various areas in the `basal ganglia` (FMA:84013). Hemiballismus is usually characterized by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities. The movements are often violent and have wide amplitudes of motion. They are continuous and random and can involve proximal and/or distal muscles on one side of the body, while some cases even include the facial muscles. The more a patient is active, the more the movements increase. With relaxation comes a decrease in movements." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Hemiballismus is a very rare movement disorder. It is five hundred times rarer than Parkinson disease. Its effects can sometimes be severe enough to prevent patients from being able to perform daily functions. It is usually associated with structural brain lesions but can occur with metabolic abnormalities. The symptoms can also decrease while the patient is asleep, unlike some movement disorders.

def: "Senile plaques are extracellular deposits of amyloid in the gray matter of the brain." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Senile plaques can be found in human and animal brains. From an age of 60 years (10%) to an age of 80 years (60%) the proportion of people with plaques increases approximately linearly. A small number of plaques can be due to the physiological process of aging. Women are slightly more likely to have plaques than males. The plaques occur commonly in the amygdoid nucleus and the sulci of the cortex of brain. The deposits are associated with degenerative neural structures and an abundance of microglia and astrocytes. Large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are characteristic features of Alzheimers disease, and some of the abnormal neurites in senile plaques are composed primarily of paired helical filaments, a component of neurofibrillary tangles. In Alzheimer's disease they are primarily composed of amyloid beta peptides. These polypeptides tend to aggregate and are believed to be neurotoxic.

comment: Hands and feet in one individual might be similarly affected or very diverse and the phenotype is very variable even within families. Penetrance is reduced and some idnividuals have been observed presenting only with unilateral smaller 2nd toe which may be overlooked till a much more severly affected family member is seen.

Tendons are similar to ligaments and fascia as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone, and fascia connect muscles to other muscles. Tendons and muscles work together and can only exert a pulling force.

comment: The aberrant innervation leading to this phenomenon may be seen for example as a hereditary trait in some patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome in which case it may occur unilateral or bilateral, but it may also result from a secondary aberrant reinnervation following a peripheral facial palsy, in which case it is associated with uncontrollable ipsilateral tearing. In the past gustatory lacrimation was considered to be a very rare non-hereditary type of anomalous, cranial nerve-end organ innervation but rare occurences in patients with Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome have shown, that this feature may also appear as a hereditary condition.

def: "`Hemorrhage` (MPATH:119) occurring between the `dura mater` (FMA:9592) and the `arachnoid mater` (FMA:9591)." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Usually resulting from tears in veins that cross the subdural space, subdural hemorrhage may cause an increase in intracranial pressure, which can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Subdural hematomas are often life-threatening when acute, but chronic subdural hematomas are usually not deadly if treated.

The swelling can also occur elsewhere, typically in the hands." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Apart from the common form, mediated by allergy, it has been reported as a side effect of some medications, in particular ACE inhibitors. Additionally, there are three autosomal dominant inherited forms known, due to mutations in the genes that control the clotting cascade, including the SERPING1 gene, which results in deficiency of the blood protein C1-inhibitor (type I HAE) and the F12 gene, which controls Factor XII (type III HAE). There is an additional type in which C1 levels are normal but C1 function is decreased (type II HAE). All three forms are called hereditary angioedema (HAE) or occasionally by the outdated term 'hereditary angioneurotic edema' (HANE). In all forms of HAE, swelling may also occur in the digestive tract and other organs. It is life-threatening when it involves the larynx due to the potential for asphyxiation.

def: "Tibial torsion is inward twisting (`medial roation`)(PATO:0002155) of the `tibia` (FMA:24476)." [HPO:sdoelken]
comment: Normally, lateral rotation of the tibia increases from approximately 5º at birth to approximately 15º at maturity. Tibial torsion is the most common cause of intoeing. In a study by Mullaji et al to determine tibial torsion norms, individuals in India were found to have less tibial torsion than Caucasians but about the same amount as the Japanese population. The differences in normal tibial torsion values are expected to be caused by the different lifestyles and postures of the different populations, such as cross-legged sitting positions.

def: "The presence of a characteristic high-pitched cry that sounds similar to the meowing of a kitten." [HPO:probinson]
comment: This unusual cry is characteristic of the cri du chat syndrome which results from a deletion on the p arm of chromosome 5. It is thought to be due to laryngeal hypoplasia, floppy epiglottis, small larynx, and asymmetric vocal cords, but is probably also related to dysfunction of the central nervous system. This sign occurs in infants and disappears with age.
