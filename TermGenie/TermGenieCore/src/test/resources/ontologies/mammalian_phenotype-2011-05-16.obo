remark: The Mammalian Phenotype Ontology is being developed by Cynthia L. Smith, Susan M. Bello, Carroll W. Goldsmith and Janan T. Eppig, as part of the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) Project, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI), The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. Copyright 2007 The Jackson Laboratory. This file contains pre-coordinated phenotype terms, definitions and synonyms that can be used to describe mammalian phenotypes. The ontology is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). It organizes phenotype terms into major biological system headers such as nervous system and respiratory system.  Behavior and lethality terms are also represented. This ontology is currently under development. Daily updates are available at the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) ftp site (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/index.html#pheno) as well as the OBO Foundry site (http://obofoundry.org/). Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome, and should be directed to pheno@informatics.jax.org MGD is funded by NIH/NHGRI grant HG000330.

comment: The synonym abnormal hippocampal formation is a frequently used synonym in the literature for the hippocampus. It is unfortunate that it implies a developmental process. There is also a lack of consensus relating to terms describing the hippocampus and/or the adjacent cerebral cortex with the term hippocampus sometimes referring to the hippocampal formation (or region) and sometimes only to the Ammon gyrus (Ammon's horn). In this ontology, we have used hippocampus to mean the entire formation (region).

comment: In rodents, the prostate gland consists of three lobes, the anterior prostate (AP; also known as the coagulating gland), the dorsolateral prostate (DLP), and the ventral prostate (VP). These lobes are arranged circumferentially around the urethra and display characteristic patterns of ductal branching and protein secretion (PMID:3308446). In contrast, the adult human prostate lacks discernible lobular organization and, instead, completely envelops the urethra at the base of the bladder (PMID:3308446).

The names embryonic lethality and embryonic death have been retained as a narrow synonyms to aid in searching for those species that may use these terms as synonyms.

Barbering is particularly common in C57BL/6 and A2G but nearly unseen in other strains. This term should always be used in relation to the control and strain should be specified.

comment: Note that significant differences exist among populations of melanocytes that populate the cutaneous tissue compared to melanocytes that populate ocular, auditory, and internal body sites. Extracutaneous melanotcytes synthesize melanosomes and melanin only during a short interval after arriving in their target tissue, and they retain their melanosomes throughout the life of the organism instead of transferring to neighboring cells like dermal melanocytes. General morphology and ultrastructure of extracutaneous melanocytes vary and also differ from cutaneous melanocytes.

name: increased heart rate variability
def: "increased variation of beat-to-beat intervals of the heart that occurs in conjunction with the respiratory cycle" [RGD:cur "Rat Genome Database submission"]
comment: Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat-to-beat intervals. A healthy heart has a large HRV, while decreased or absent variability may indicate cardiac disease. HRV also decreases with exercise-induced tachycardia. Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate. Under resting conditions, the ECG of healthy individuals exhibits periodic variation in R-R intervals. This rhythmic phenomenon, known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), fluctuates with the phase of respiration -- cardio-acceleration during inspiration, and cardio-deceleration during expiration. RSA is predominantly mediated by respiratory gating of parasympathetic efferent activity to the heart: vagal efferent traffic to the sinus node occurs primarily in phase with expiration and is absent or attenuated during inspiration. The major reason for the interest in measuring HRV stems from its ability to predict survival after heart attack. Over half a dozen prospective studies have shown that reduced HRV predicts sudden death in patients with MI, independent of other prognostic indicators such as ejection fraction. Reduced HRV appears to be a marker of fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Moreover, a small number of studies have begun to suggest that reduced HRV may predict risk of survival even among individuals free of CHD.

comment: Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variation of beat-to-beat intervals. A healthy heart has a large HRV, while decreased or absent variability may indicate cardiac disease. HRV also decreases with exercise-induced tachycardia. Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate. Under resting conditions, the ECG of healthy individuals exhibits periodic variation in R-R intervals. This rhythmic phenomenon, known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), fluctuates with the phase of respiration -- cardio-acceleration during inspiration, and cardio-deceleration during expiration. RSA is predominantly mediated by respiratory gating of parasympathetic efferent activity to the heart: vagal efferent traffic to the sinus node occurs primarily in phase with expiration and is absent or attenuated during inspiration. The major reason for the interest in measuring HRV stems from its ability to predict survival after heart attack. Over half a dozen prospective studies have shown that reduced HRV predicts sudden death in patients with MI, independent of other prognostic indicators such as ejection fraction. Reduced HRV appears to be a marker of fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Moreover, a small number of studies have begun to suggest that reduced HRV may predict risk of survival even among individuals free of CHD.

comment: Follicular dendritic cells are a distinct population from other dendritic cells associated with T cells. Follicular dendritic cells have Fc receptors and C3b receptors, but unlike other dendritic cells, they do not process or present antigen in a way that allows recognition by T cells. Instead, they hold antigen in the form of immune complexes on their surfaces for long periods and can present antigen to B cells during an immune response. They are not derived from the hematopoietic lineage. Due to its unique lineage and distinct function (B cell vs. T cell presentation), this is NOT a type of dendritic cell.

Extracutaneous melanotcytes synthesize melanosomes and melanin only during a short interval after arriving in their target tissue, and they retain their melanosomes throughout the life of the organism instead of transferring to neighboring cells like dermal melanocytes.

comment: The culmen lobule (lobules IV/V) is a single structure in humans, but it is divided by the intraculminate fissure in many rodents. In some mouse strains such as SLJ/J, the intraculminate fissure is absent, in some strains such as DBA/2J it is present, and other strains (C57BL/10J and BALB/cJ) exhibit considerable variablility (PMID: 1953602).

def: "a reduction in the concentration in the blood of an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of creatine to phosphocreatine" [MGI:csmith "Cynthia L. Smith, Mouse Genome Informatics Curator"]
comment: There is ambiguity in the literature regarding the terms creatinine kinase and creatine kinase. Most resources insist that creatine kinase is correct. See PMID:17174558 and PMID: 14624200 not to mention Wikipedia.

comment: Note that there is no consensus in the literature about whether the perifollicular zone (which does not exist in rodents) is part of the splenic red or white pulp. Notable differences in the structure of the spleen exist between humans and rodents. In this ontology, the marginal sinus (which doen not exist in human) has been included as part of the white pulp and may be the rodent functional equivalent of the human perifollicular zone.
